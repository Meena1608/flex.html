        <center><div class="flex">Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder<br> Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often brightly coloured wings<br> that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous,<br> fluttering flight. The group comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea<br> (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others). The<br> oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years<br> ago, though they likely originated in the Late Cretaceous, about 101 million years ago.[1]<br>

            Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, and like other<br> holometabolous insects they undergo complete metamorphosis Winged adults<br> lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will<br> feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed,<br> pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the<br> adult insect climbs out, expands its wings to dry, and flies off.
           
            Some<br> butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year,<br> while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several<br> years to pass through their entire life cycle.[3]</div></center>
